📌 Frontend Developer Intern — Shortlisting Assignment
Project: Restaurant_DineBook
📖 Project Overview

Restaurant_DineBook is a responsive restaurant dine-in table booking web application built as part of the Frontend Developer Intern shortlisting assignment.

Due to the time-boxed nature (~2 hours) of the assignment, the project focuses on frontend UI/UX quality, responsiveness, form handling, validation, and database integration, with a minimal backend to store booking data.

🎯 Assignment Context
The given task required building an Auth + Dashboard + CRUD based web application with frontend as the primary focus and backend as supportive.

Based on the limited time, I chose to:
Prioritize frontend responsiveness and usability
Build a realistic restaurant table booking flow
Integrate the form with MongoDB to store booking data
Ensure proper client-side validation and user feedback

✅ What I Have Implemented
🖥️ Frontend (Primary Focus)
✅ Built using React.js
✅ Fully responsive UI
✅ Custom CSS used instead of Tailwind / UI libraries
CSS was intentionally used to clearly understand layout, spacing, and responsiveness

✅ Restaurant table booking form with the following fields:
First Name
Last Name
Email
Phone Number
Date
Time

✅ Client-side validation for booking Dine:
Required field validation
Phone number validation (exactly 11 digits)

✅ Popup error message shown when phone number is less or more than 11 digits
✅ Success message displayed on successful booking
✅ Clean, user-friendly, and accessible UI
🗄️ Backend (Minimal / Supportive)
✅ Built using Node.js + Express
✅ Connected to MongoDB
✅ Booking data stored in database
✅ API used to submit and store reservation details
✅ Basic error handling implemented

❌ What I Did NOT Implement (And Why)
Due to limited time (~2 hours), the following assignment requirements were not implemented in this project:
Authentication & Dashboard
❌ User Signup / Login
❌ JWT-based authentication
❌ Protected dashboard routes
❌ User profile APIs
  
CRUD Scope
❌ Full CRUD UI (Create, Read, Update, Delete) inside this project
Note:
CRUD functionality has been implemented in my other projects, which are available on my GitHub portfolio.
